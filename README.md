Welcome,
Add the bibliotheque.sql to your dataBase on PhpMyAdmin
Be careful this dataBase is for MacOS so you maybe have to modify it a little (normally no).
If your are not using MacOS remember to change the password in pdo.php: 
for MacOs it's : "root" 
for Windows it's : " "

This project is the first exercise in php, it's a books library where you can add, remove, modify every books only if you are connected, and to be connected you have to be register.

Second commit add a better error gestion and a file gestion whith $_FILE. The image will be stocked in the uploads directory. For the inscritpion the phone number and the profil picture are not a must have
